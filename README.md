I created this game to demonstrate my understanding and apptitude in Javascript. I played of lot of real time strategy games throught my life. I always liked the idea of certain units countering others. There always was an aspect of rock paper scissors to it. So I felt rebranding rock paper scissors to have a real time strategy aspect to it would work well.

Battle for Zenethir is a single web page made up of these sections:

1. Start/Title screen.
2. Match section.
3. Score section.
4. Choices section. 
5. Win/Lose screen.

Site owner's goals:

1. Create a fun game loop to keep the player interested in the game.
2. Allow the player to make choices as to which unit they will send.
3. Allow the player to quit after winning or losing.
4. Add difficulty to the game so the player can win/ be defeated.
5. Allow the player to check the rules whenever they need. 

User goal's:

1. As a first-time visitor: I want to check the rules of the game.
2. As a first-time visitor: I want to play a game with a fun probability aspect to it.
3. As a first-time visitor: I want to beat the computer in a game of probability.
4. As a recurring or first-time visitor: I want to beat my record in defeating the computer.
5. As a recurring or first-time visator: I want to be able to quit the game at any time.

# UX / UI

## Strategy 

After thinking about the strategy for my site. I came up with a target audience, which would influence the features included.

### Target users:

1. 18-40 years old.
2. Interested in RTS (Real Time strategy) games.
3. People interested in probability.
4. People interested in fantasy settings.
5. People interested in appealing art styles.

### What the user would look for:

* Easy to understand and visually appealing art style.
* A simple and clean site (Easy to navigate).
* An addictive game loop.
* An easy to understand list of rules.
* An ability to leave the game at any time.
* A fun game based on probability.

I really love simple and clean webstie designs, so I tried to achieve that with mine. The artwork is flat and doesnt try to call to much attention to itself. The UI is simple and stands out against the background. With the simple layout it helps when making it responsive for mobile and tablet users. 

## Scope

To help the user achieve their desired experience, these features were included:

* A simple and visually appealing art syle was created to keep the user entertained.
* A quit button to allow the user to stop at any time.
* A rules section for the user to understand the games rules.
* A simple score system that would encourage the player to beat the computer.
* A series of choices allowing the user to rely on probability.
* A fun randomly generated slogan at the main title. (For people interested in fantasy.)

## Structure 

This is a single web page. It contains the title screen which introduces the player to the theme and setting. The rules sesction which shows the player which unit beats another. As well as an explanation of the game. The quit button gives the player the chance to leave whenever they would like. The choice section presents all of the units that the player and computer will choose in a match. The match section displays images based on the choices of the computer and user. The score section indicates who is winning and who is close to defeating their enemy. Lastly the victory and defeat popups tell the player of their loss or win. 

The game was intended to have a fun aspect to it. With the simple game loop and the randomly generated slogans. I wanted to be able to dress up a game of rock paper scissors so much. That you would not realise you were playing it anymore.
