I created this game to demonstrate my understanding and apptitude in Javascript. I played of lot of real time strategy games throught my life. I always liked the idea of certain units countering others. There always was an aspect of rock paper scissors to it. So I felt rebranding rock paper scissors to have a real time strategy aspect to it would work well.

Battle for Mordor is a single web page made up of these sections:

1. Start/Title screen.
2. Match section.
3. Score section.
4. Choices section. 
5. Win/Lose screen.

Site owner's goals:

1. Create a fun game loop to keep the player interested in the game.
2. Allow the player to make choices as to which unit they will send.
3. Allow the player to quit after winning or losing.
4. Add difficulty to the game so the player can win/ be defeated.
5. Allow the player to check the rules whenever they need. 

User goal's:

1. As a first-time visitor: I want to check the rules of the game.
2. As a first-time visitor: I want to play a game with a fun probability aspect to it.
3. As a first-time visitor: I want to beat the computer in a game of probability.
4. As a recurring or first-time visitor: I want to beat my record in defeating the computer.
5.

The UI is simple and stands out against the background. With the simple layout it helps when making it responsive for mobile and tablet users.

## Scope

To help the user achieve their desired experience, these features were included:
